# Simple-Weekday-Planner-Python-
This is just a simple tkinter application where you can write plans for the different weekdays. The purpose of this project was 
simply to learn more about how I can use JSON objects in python to save the data a user writes from a tkinter application. 
Together with the tkinter widgets it consists of two simple functions. One functions that save the user typed information to a 
json object and another function that loads the json object information that's been saved.
